# Primula syntax parser

This code builds a syntax tree from a stream of lexemes, which were generated by preprocessor.

Builing of syntax tree accomplished with several stages. On first stage a code within file __./lexem_tree_root.cc__  splits lexemes into a tree. 
On second stage lexemes in the tree are being transformed to a parser's internal structures. File __./namespace.h__ defines main interface of the Primula syntax parser.
Function main() of syntax parser is defined in file __./syntax.cc__

We have no real codegenerators yet. Therefore we restore a C source code back from a syntax tree  to see that parsing was correct. Source code restorer location is folder __../codegen__
