# Primula
This is a set of C language parsers. A some subset of C++ is also supported.

∙ The  folder "./include"  holds common header files.

∙ The  folder "./lexic_parser" holds a source code of combined preprocessor and lexical parser of C files and perhaps some of C++ files.

∙ The  folder "./syntax_parser" holds a source code of a syntax parser. Syntax parser builds syntax tree in memory and trying to restore  a source code from this tree.
