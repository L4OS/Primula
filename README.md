# Primula parsers
This is a set of C language parsers. A some subset of C++ is also supported.

∙ The  folder "./codegen" keeps a builder of source code from syntax tree.

∙ The  folder "./include"  holds common header files.

∙ The  folder "./lexic_parser" holds a source code of combined preprocessor and lexical parser of C files and perhaps some of C++ files.

∙ The  folder "./syntax_parser" holds a source code of a syntax parser.
