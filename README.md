# Primula Parsers

This is a set of C language parsers. A some subset of C++ is also supported.

## Contents

- The  folder "./include"  holds common header files.

- The  folder "./lexic_parser" holds a source code of combined preprocessor and lexical parser of C files and perhaps some of C++ files.

- The  folder "./syntax_parser" holds a source code of a syntax parser.

- The  folder "./codegen" keeps a builder of C source code from syntax tree.

- The  folder "./codegen/Pascal" keeps a translator of the Primula syntax tree to Pascal program. (Under development)

Each subfolder has it's own README.md file with description and hints.
